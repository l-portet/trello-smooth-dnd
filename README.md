# trello-smooth-dnd
Trello smooth drag and drop
> The structure of this project only remains on 3 main files (`index.html`, `index.js` and `main.scss`) because it was basically a pen developped on Codepen. It's not meant to be an independent or reusable package.

Here's a [live demo](https://codepen.io/l-portet/full/jObbRYJ).

Inspired by this [article](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-fix-dragging-animation-in-ui-with-simple-math-4bbc10deccf7).
